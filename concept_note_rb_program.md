# Concept note KOOMPI STEM Program
## Tool For each Program
### Elementary
For Elementary We gonna build K-BOTS and write Educations book
#### What's K-BOTS ?
K-BOTS (KOOMPI BOTS) is robot will inspired children from 7-12 years start to engage with programming, science, electronic in a way by to build it , program it and observe it. Children can learn program by follow the program inside instructions steps by steps. the robot will program by Scratch and have kid-friendly design allow kid easy understand to build and learn.
### Middle School
For Middle School we gonna build Koompi Smart Electronics kits

#### What's Koompi Smart Electronic kits ?
We gonna build Koompi Smart Electronics kits
#### What's Koompi Smart Electronic kits ?l
Koompi Smart Electronics kits is electronic component that's allow kid from 10 year to 14 years experience basic electronic component. The designs it's really kid-friendly allow kid easy to study about basic and program it to follow they creativity or follow the instruction. When children play this kits children will increase creativity and understand basic electronic and programming electronic by Scratch Programming.
